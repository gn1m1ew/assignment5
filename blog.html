    <h4> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems? </h4>
    <p> I have encountered a lot of problems in this assignment, and there are still some problems that have not been solved. The main </p>
    <p> problem this time is that he won't increase after I created the twit twit, I' ve tried a lot of ways that won't work. I have been </p>
    <p> troubled by this problem for a long time, although I set up my code, I also read piazza, but I still have not solved my problem. </p>
    <p> Through Google search, I learned to solve other problems. By watching Hess video, I can use some code in my homework and can run. </p>
    <p> This is very helpful to me. </p>

    <h4> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew? </h4>
    <p> I learned a lot in this assignment, but I tried a lot and still didn't solve the problem of creating twit, which made me very </p>
    <p> upset. Everything else is not very difficult, I through some classroom code, other external code can solve the problem. </p>

    <h4> What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h4>
    <p> I think the classroom notes are the most helpful, the teacher has made most of the code templates that need to be used clearly in class, the problem we encounter in </p>
    <p> the process of writing homework is that we may not be familiar with the use of a certain piece of code, need to ask TA to get help. TA these questions are basically </p>
    <p> answered, we also learn more about the relevant code application. </p>

    <h4> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment? </h4>
    <p> I used google to check some font settings, and some code templates in approximate format, through which I refined my code. </p>
